#Neovim Configuration

A base neovim configuration that is set up to my liking.

This configuration is heavily inspired by ThePrimeagen and chris@machine's
intro nvim videos.

Some things to consider:
* ToggleTerm - currently, I'm either using suspend/`fg` if I need one terminal
  command or I'm opening a new tab in xterm to run something like `npm start`
